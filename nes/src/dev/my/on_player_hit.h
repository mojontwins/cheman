// Add here your code. Player has been hit by an enemy.

// The default action can be overriden assigning values to flags:
// en_sg_1 controls if enemy suffers or not.
// en_sg_2 controls if player suffers or not.

// If:
// - Player will suffer (hit registered, not spinning): en_sg_2
// - Player has rings (prings)
// Then create animated ring, and simulate hit but don't hurt player!
